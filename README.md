### :arrow_forward: Analysis 2
Logistic team wants to conducts analysis of their performance in 1997, to identify which countries didn’t perform well. They asked us to provide them the list of countries with the following information:

A. Average days between order date and shipping date

B. Total number of unique orders (based on order id) 

Filtered based on the following conditions:
 
A. Order date is in 1997

B. Average days between order date and shipping date is >= 3 days but < 20 days 

C. Total number of orders is greater than 5

Order the results by average days between the order date and the shipping date in descending order.

```SQL

	   WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR from(order_date)) = 1997
	   GROUP BY days, ship_country,order_id
	   ORDER BY ship_country ASC)


SELECT *
